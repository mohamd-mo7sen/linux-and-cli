# Linux and Command Line Interface (CLI) Course

This repository contains my notes and exercises for the Linux and CLI course.

it's useful to know why something was created to understand what problems it can solve with it.
# linux vs unix
you may think it's the same thing but no unix (1970s) exist before linux (1990s) this is why you hear the phrase that linux is unix-based they are built on principles and architectures that originated in Unix
While it's unlikely you'll encounter someone who has installed the Unix operating system on their personal computer, this is largely because Unix was originally designed for large-scale enterprise systems and servers. 
Furthermore, Unix is a proprietary system, owned and sold by specific companies, which makes it less accessible for personal use.
# why linux then
Given these factors, there was a need for an operating system that was accessible, free, and**suitable for personal computers**.
This led to the creation of Linux in the early 1990s by Linus Torvalds.
Linux was designed to be a free and open-source system that follows the design principles of Unix, making it a more accessible alternative. 
Because it's open-source, Linux has been adapted into many different distributions, catering to various types of users and systems, from personal computers to servers. 
This has allowed a Unix-like system to reach a wider audience and be used in ways that the original Unix system was not designed for.
