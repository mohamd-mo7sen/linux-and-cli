# You have some options to run linux here is what i was encountered so far:

* Dual Boot: You can partition your hard drive and install Linux alongside your current operating system. This allows you to choose which operating system to boot into when you start your computer.

* **Virtual Machine:** You can use software like VirtualBox or VMware to run Linux inside a virtual machine on your current operating system. This allows you to use Linux without having to restart your computer or partition your hard drive.

* **Live USB/CD:** You can create a bootable USB stick or CD with a Linux distribution. This allows you to boot into Linux without installing anything on your hard drive. This is a good option if you just want to try out Linux.

* **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**: If you're using Windows 10 and newer version, you can use WSL to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, without the overhead of a virtual machine.

  ## some differnces between VM and Dual Bot
  ### virtual machine:
   * VMs are an operating system running within another operating system, called the host machine.
    The host machine will create a virtual environment with virtual acccess to its hardware to the VM.
    The VM will have no idea that it's not actually running on real hardware; all it can see is the resources that the host is providing it.
   * You can run both operating systems at the same time.
   * you can switch between the host operating system and the guest operating system (the VM) without needing to restart your computer.
   * It requires more resources (CPU, RAM) because you're running two operating systems simultaneously.

  ### Dual Boot:
  * You get the full performance of your hardware because you're only running one operating system at a time.
  * It doesn't require as much resources (CPU, RAM) as a VM.
  * You have to reboot to switch between operating systems.
